# hello-world
First repository
I'm Clickomat. I'm new to the programming realm and am trying to learn as much as I can in order to make a change in professional vocations. Currently I work in health care but feel stuck and want to tap into my creative side. Id like to design web sites and perhaps even administer a few. I have a friend with his own company that I will be trying to design a site for using "Atom" text editor. Im am taking courses from a local university.
Here I Go! Wish me luck!
